README
Project Overview
This project is a Next.js application designed to demonstrate key features and functionalities as specified in the assignment brief. The application is structured to be easily maintainable and scalable.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js
npm 
Installation
Clone the Repository:

git clone 

npm install
# or
yarn install
Run the Development Server:


npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
This will start the development server on http://localhost:3000.

Build for Production:

npm run build
# or
yarn build
This command creates an optimized production build of your application in the .next directory.

Run the Production Server:


npm start
# or
yarn start
This will start the application in production mode.

Hosting
To host the build, use a platform like Vercel, Netlify, or any other static site hosting service. Follow their documentation to deploy the built application from the .next directory.

Design Document
Introduction
This document outlines the design choices made during the development of the Next.js application. The primary goal was to create a maintainable, scalable, and efficient application.

Architecture and Folder Structure
app/: Contains the main application components.

api/: Includes all API routes. Following Next.js conventions, API routes are defined here to handle server-side logic.
dashboard/: A separate folder for the dashboard feature, with its own layout and components.
apply/: Contains the form for the application process.
components/: Houses reusable UI components.

ui/: A subfolder within components for UI-specific elements that can be reused across different parts of the application.
Design Choices
Next.js Framework:


No State Management Library:

At this stage, the application only requires simple data fetching and display, which is effectively managed by React Query.
In the future, if the application needs more complex state management, libraries like Redux or Zustand could be considered.
React Query for Data Fetching:

React Query was used to manage server-state, ensuring efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization between the client and server.
Authentication with Clerk:

Clerk was integrated to handle authentication, providing a simple and secure way to manage user sign-ups, logins, and sessions.
Component-Based Architecture:

Reusable components are placed in the components/ui folder to promote code reuse and maintainability.
Each feature (like dashboard and apply) is encapsulated in its own folder to maintain a clear separation of concerns.
Future Considerations
State Management:

For more complex client-side state management needs, consider integrating Redux or Zustand.
This would be particularly useful if synchronous state management becomes necessary.
Scalability:

The current folder structure supports scalability by clearly separating different parts of the application.
Additional features can be easily integrated without disrupting the existing structure.
Conclusion
The design and implementation of this application prioritize maintainability, scalability, and adherence to Next.js best practices. Future enhancements can be smoothly incorporated, thanks to the clear and modular structure of the codebase.
